	Number: Any number, including numbers with decimals: 4, 8, 1516, 23.42.
•	String: Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.) surrounded by single quotes: ' ... ' or double quotes " ... ". Though we prefer single quotes. Some people like to think of string as a fancy word for text.
•	Boolean: This data type only has two possible values— either true or false (without quotes). It’s helpful to think of booleans as on and off switches or as the answers to a “yes” or “no” question.
•	Null: This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword null (without quotes).
•	Undefined: This data type is denoted by the keyword undefined (without quotes). It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than null.
•	Symbol: A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more complex coding. No need to worry about these for now.
•	Object: Collections of related data.

There are also space punctuation and capital and lowercase letters and words
You can also do mathematical equations

Description : Javascript notes for July 20

a period (the dot operator)
the name of the method
opening and closing parentheses

This process of appending one string to another is called concatenation.
 Notice in the third example we had to make sure to include a space at the end of the first string. 
 The computer will join the strings exactly, so we needed to make sure to include the space we wanted between the two strings.

 In addition to console, there are other objects built into JavaScript.
  Down the line, you’ll build your own objects, but for now these “built-in” objects are full of useful functionality.
